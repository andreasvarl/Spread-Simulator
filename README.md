# Spread-Simulator
This project is an interactive simulation tool for modeling the spread of infectious diseases using the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) and SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) epidemiological models.
Built with Python, Matplotlib, and ipywidgets, the simulator allows users to adjust key parameters such as transmission rate, recovery rate, incubation rate, and initial population values â€” and instantly visualize how an epidemic evolves over time.

To install the widgets and the  necessary libraries use this commands in your Anavonda Prompt:
conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
conda install numpy matplotlib

Enjoy your simulation!!
